							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em;margin-bottom: 2.5em;color:#435353 ;">
								The automotive industry was fighting with the challenge of designing larger vehicles without sacrificing fuel efficiency or safety. This project aimed to upgrade a previous model while maintaining its cost-effective profile.</p>

								<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 26px;margin-bottom: 0em; "><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>	
								<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em;margin-bottom: 2.5em;color:#435353 ;">
									The primary challenge was designing a rear bumper that could accommodate the increased dimensions of the vehicle without compromising its structural integrity, performance, or cost-effectiveness. 
									Additionally, we needed to minimize any weight gain to preserve fuel efficiency.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 2.5em; color:#435353 ;">As a team leader, I spearheaded the development of an innovative steel-plastic rear bumper. 
								This design combined the strength of steel with the lightweight properties of plastic, attaching plastic components to an existing steel surface that was not originally designed for such attachments. 
								To ensure the necessary structural integrity, we implemented a new steel formation process that had never been done in the industry. 
								This innovative approach allowed us to significantly enhance the strength of the steel component.
								<li>Cost savings of over 52% compared to conventional methods.</li>
								<li>A 25% reduction in development lead time.</li>
								<li>Achievement of the target weight increase.</li>

							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em;margin-bottom: 2.5em; color:#435353 ;">In the collaborative process of car design, designers often envision innovative aesthetics without considering the underlying engineering constraints. 
								As design engineers, our role is crucial in ensuring that the desired styling can be realized while maintaining the vehicle's functionality and performance.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; color:#435353 ;">Given the innovative nature of the new styling design, I had to ensure the engineering feasibility of the fog lamp cover, considering its production, as well as its interaction with surrounding components. 
								Additionally, I needed to balance the part's structural integrity with pedestrian safety requirements, preventing excessive stiffness that could compromise impact absorption. 
								Finally, I had to address potential light leakage or reflection issues to ensure optimal fog lamp performance.</p>

							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em;margin-bottom: 2.5em; color:#435353 ;">The Robosub competition challenges teams to design and build autonomous underwater vehicles capable of completing a series of tasks. 
								A crucial component of many Robosub designs is a gripper, which enables the AUV to interact with its environment and perform tasks such as manipulating objects or collecting samples.</p>

						
							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 26px;margin-bottom: 0em; "><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>		
							<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; color:#435353 ;">Designing a gripper for a Robosub presents several unique challenges. 
								The gripper must be compact and lightweight to fit within the size and weight constraints of the AUV. It must also be maneuverable and capable of grasping and manipulating objects of various shapes and sizes. 
								Additionally, the gripper must be able to lift and carry objects without compromising the AUV's stability or speed. Finally, it must be designed to effectively perform the specific tasks required in the Robosub competition, such as retrieving objects from underwater obstacles or interacting with underwater structures.</p>

								<strong>- Reliability:</strong></br> To ensure durability in the harsh underwater environment, I selected high-corrosion-resistant aluminum as the primary material for the gripper. This choice provides the necessary strength and resistance to saltwater while minimizing weight.
							    </br></br><strong>- Efficiency:</strong></br> To optimize power consumption and reduce weight, I implemented a single-pneumatic-cylinder design. This streamlined approach minimizes the number of moving parts and reduces energy requirements.
							    </br></br><strong>- Functionality: </strong></br>To enhance the gripper's ability to grasp and manipulate objects effectively, I incorporated guided grips and pneumatic control. 
							                </br>By analyzing the AUV's movements during typical tasks, I optimized the gripper's design to ensure accurate and reliable object manipulation. 
										    </br>Additionally, the pneumatic cylinder's position can be used as an additional guidance mechanism, further improving the gripper's precision.
